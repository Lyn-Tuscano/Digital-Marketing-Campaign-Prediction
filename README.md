# Digital-Marketing-Campaign-Prediction

## Project Overview:
This project aims to enhance campaign effectiveness in the digital marketing sector by accurately predicting customer conversions. By leveraging machine learning, the project seeks to identify potential converters and optimize marketing strategies. The objective is to develop a robust machine learning model that predicts customer conversions based on various demographic and engagement factors, enabling improved campaign targeting, increased conversion rates, and maximized return on advertising spend (ROAS).
